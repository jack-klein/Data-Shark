NAME
    Data::Shark - load various Data::Shark modules

SYNOPSIS
    use Data::Shark;

DESCRIPTION
    Data::Shark provides a simple mechanism to load some of the Data::Shark
    modules at one go.

    Currently this includes:

          Data::Shark::DB
          Data::Shark::DIO
          Data::Shark::FIO
          Data::Shark::Util

  Data::Shark::DBI
    The database layer provides some simple wrappers around the DBI. By
    using the simple wrappers a single point of error/status logging can be
    achieved, along with code size reduction.

  Data::Shark::DIO
    The DIO module generates data access functions. This allows a simple
    consistant interface for all data interaction, the functions can be read
    into memory or placed in file. Each function is defined by a namespace,
    group, name, type, statement, return type, etc. And has a set of input
    keys and output keys. Currently SQL access is supported, but others will
    be added. This modules removes any data access dependencies from a
    program. There is also support for caching, replication and profiling.

    Example:

        my $result = MyNameSpace::MyGroup::get_customer(
          {'customer_id' => $cid});

    If the return type is a hash, then the results are placed in a hash
    reference.

        $result->{'name'}, $result->{'address'}, etc.

  Data::Shark::Util
    The Util module contains a collection of helper methods.
